# µPCN Contacts Data Format

Via bundles to the `<µPCN_EID>/config` endpoint, connected nodes as well as upcoming contacts with them can be configured.

## Description

The used data format is as follows:

```
<COMMAND><NODE_ID_STRING><,RELIABILITY><:CLA_ADDRESS_STRING><:REACHABLE_EID_LIST><:CONTACT_LIST>;
```

There are three basic values for `COMMAND` that can be used to configure µPCN via this interface:
  * `1` representing **ADD**: Create the provided node if it does not exist and assign the associated endpoints and contacts to it.
  * `2` representing **REPLACE**: Delete the node if it exists already, then re-create it with the provided data.
  * `3` representing **DELETE**: Delete the given endpoints or contacts from the given node, or delete the node altogether if no endpoints or contacts are provided.

`NODE_ID_STRING` is always mandatory. All strings shall be enclosed in parentheses, e.g., `(dtn://upcn2.dtn)` is a valid node ID string.

The `RELIABILITY` value is optional and shall be an integer number between 100 and 1000 and represent the expected likelihood that a future contact with the given node will be observed, divided by 1000.0.

`CLA_ADDRESS_STRING` is mandatory when creating a node and uses the same string representation as the node ID and consists of the convergence layer adapter and the node address, e.g., `(tcpclv3:127.0.0.1:1234)`.

`REACHABLE_EID_LIST` is optional and shall be enclosed in square brackets and contain comma-separated EIDs in the same string representation as the node ID.

`CONTACT_LIST` is optional and shall also be enclosed in square brackets. It contains comma-separated contacts in the following format:

```
{<START_DTN_TIME>,<END_DTN_TIME>,<DATA_RATE>,<REACHABLE_EID_LIST>}
```

The `START_DTN_TIME` and `END_DTN_TIME` shall be integer DTN timestamps in seconds. The `DATA_RATE` shall be an integer number representing the expected transmission rate in bytes per second. The `REACHABLE_EID_LIST` uses the same format as the one for the node and is appended only for the specific contact.
